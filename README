requirements:
  (1) if you are using LINUX, make sure you have installed:
        [coreutils, wget, iconv, gcc]
  (2) if you are using WINDOWS + CYGWIN, you need install these packages:
        [wget, gcc-core, libiconv]
	  you also need a text editor to edit config files:
	    [nano or vim] (you can choose whatever you like)
      p.s. the performance of cygwin is really bad
  (3) other plantforms are not tested, you can try it yourself.


warning:
  ==> USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! <==
  THIS PROGRAM HAS MANY SECURITY HOLES, SUCH AS SHELL CODE INJECTION,
  BUFFER OVERFLOW... THEREFORE, THE WEBMASTER (aka. WangGuan) CAN EASYLY
  DESTORY YOUR COMPUTER!


usage:
  (1) write users and their passwords to 'userpass.conf'.
  (2) run './eol_achiever.sh'.
  (3) your documents are in '/files', and all information is logged to
      'achiever.log', downloaded lessons are in 'exclude_lid.txt' and
	  'lesson_map.txt', file renames are in 'file_map.txt'.


content-type.conf:
  sometimes the server won't tell the full file name, therefore the
  achiever need to determine the file extension itself. this file is a
  map from content-types to file-extensions. you may add you own map
  rules to this file.


extra:
  there is a small script to list users called 'get_user_list.sh'.
  you need add at least one user to 'userpass.conf' first.
  for example, you can use './get_user_list.sh 14' to list 142XXXX.
